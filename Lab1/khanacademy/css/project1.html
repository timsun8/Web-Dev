        <p class="text">The <strong>Galápagos     Islands</strong> are an <em>archipelago</em> of volcanic islands located in the Pacific Ocean, 
            approximately 1,000 kilometers from the coast of Ecuador. These islands are famous for their unique biodiversity 
            and played a significant role in Charles Darwin's development of the theory of evolution by natural selection. 
            The islands are home to species that can't be found anywhere else in the world, such as the <em>Galápagos tortoise</em> and the <em>marine iguana</em>. 
            The <strong>Galápagos National Park</strong> and <strong>Marine Reserve</strong> are UNESCO World Heritage sites, 
            providing protection to the delicate ecosystems found there.</p>

        <p class="text"><strong>Antelope Canyon</strong> is a unique natural formation located in the state of Arizona, USA. 
            It is a narrow canyon known for its stunning shapes and light effects that occur when sunlight hits its sandstone walls. 
            <em>The canyon is divided into two main sections</em> — Upper and Lower, both attracting tourists with their beauty 
            and mystical atmosphere. Visiting the canyon requires guided tours, as the terrain can be quite dangerous 
            and requires special knowledge for safe navigation.</p>
        <h5>What you can see...</h5>
        <ul  class = "list"> 
        <li>Flowing, wave-like sandstone formations.</li> 
        <li>Light beams that shine through narrow passages, creating beautiful color effects.

        <p class="text">The <strong>Spanish Civil War</strong> (1936-1939) was a pivotal conflict that led 
            to the rise of Francisco Franco's fascist regime in Spain. The war was fought between the <strong>Republican</strong> forces, 
            which included communists, anarchists, and other left-wing groups, and the <strong>Nationalist</strong> forces, led by Franco. 
            <strong>The war caused significant loss of life and had a lasting impact on Spanish society and politics</strong>. 
            After Franco's victory, Spain remained under authoritarian rule until his death in 1975, which eventually led to the transition to democracy.
